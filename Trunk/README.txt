ABOUT THIS RELEASE

 I am currently working to put the project scaffolding in place, 
 including the build system, support libraries, base classes, and
 unit tests. I am also working through a Big Design on the higher-
 level systems in preparation for coding.


LICENSING

 The Flat Four Engine is released under the BSD license. See
 LICENSE.txt for more information on the licensing terms.


SUPPORT LIBRARIES

 The Framework uses the following support libraries. For now you 
 will need to build these yourself (see BUILDING THE FRAMEWORK,

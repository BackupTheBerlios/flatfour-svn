* Add AssemblyInfo.cs with CLSCompliant flag (also add tickler to packaging)

* The `start` parameter on utDraw() is unused.

* Change texture formats to match Toolkit symbols

* Can I remove utMatrix4 from Toolkit wrapper?

* Remove empty Graphics folder from tests

* Unit tests for SetMatrix() and SetTexture()

* What kind of buffer options are there (static, dynamic, what else)? Have
  a look at that too.

* Popup window when exceptions are caught (sample base class)

* Trace log should use \n\r on windows so it can be read in Notepad. Engine
  messages are okay, but messages from the Toolkit are \n only.

* Write message to log when closing window, etc.

* Move .nunit file to tests directory if possible

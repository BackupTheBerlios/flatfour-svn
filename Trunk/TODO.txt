* Refactor master list of platform windows to match master list of render targets

* Editor unit tests

* Bootstrap unit tests

* Internationalize the editor

* Add AssemblyInfo.cs with CLSCompliant flag to all assemblies, except maybe
  the editor (also add tickler to packaging)
  
* The `start` parameter on utDraw() is unused.

* Change texture formats to match Toolkit symbols

* Can I remove utMatrix4 from Toolkit wrapper?

* Unit tests for SetMatrix() and SetTexture()

* What kind of buffer options are there (static, dynamic, what else)? Have
  a look at that too.

* Popup window when exceptions are caught (sample base class)

* Trace log should use \n\r on windows so it can be read in Notepad. Engine
  messages are okay, but messages from the Toolkit are \n only. Maybe do a
  Replace() on incoming text (how to detect platform EOL sequence?)

* Track all collision, rbody, gfx etc objects and call Dispose() when subsystem
  shuts down. Use weak references to allow GC, maybe abstract into separate class.

* WeakDelegates for framework update delegates, so behaviors can attach to them? 

* Be sure to call GC.SuppressFinalize() in all Dispose() methods

* Memory leaks, apparently from ODE. Route ODE memory allocations through the
  toolkit to get line numbers. Probably the static trimesh memory from last time.

* Add Dispatcher.Remove() ... compare to delegate.Target and remove if it
  matches the given instance. Also, can I use WeakDelegates? Should I?

* Refactor master list of platform windows to match master list of render targets

* Internationalize the editor

* Add AssemblyInfo.cs with CLSCompliant flag to all assemblies, except maybe
  the editor (also add tickler to packaging to update versions)
  
* The `start` parameter on utDraw() is unused.

* Change texture formats to match Toolkit symbols

* Can I remove utMatrix4 from Toolkit wrapper?

* Unit tests for SetMatrix() and SetTexture()

* What kind of buffer options are there (static, dynamic, what else)? Have
  a look at that too.

* Popup window when exceptions are caught (sample base class)

* Trace log should use \n\r on windows so it can be read in Notepad. Engine
  messages are okay, but messages from the Toolkit are \n only. Maybe do a
  Replace() on incoming text (how to detect platform EOL sequence?)

* Possible performance enhancement: Put a StepNumber in DynamicsSystem that 
  gets incremented in OnTick(). In RigidBody, keep a LastUpdatedStepNumber.
  When someone reads position or orientation, check to see if I am out of
  date (LastUpdatedStepNumber !== DS.StepNumber) and pull info.

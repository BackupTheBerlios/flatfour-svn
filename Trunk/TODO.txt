Goal: get collison shapes to track movement of pose (particularly rigid bodies)

* Only allow one scene. Formalize this somewhere as a Scene singleton or
  Framework.SceneRoot or something like that.

* On first tick, send a StartMessage to all actors in the scene. When an actor
  is added to a started scene, it gets the message immediately.

* DynamicsSystem tracks all rigid bodies with weak references. Disposes all
  bodies on shutdown.

* Each fixed update, DynamicsSystem steps and them calls MovedMessage on all
  active and non-sleeping bodies.

* Pose.Position and Orientation should be read-only properties with a setter
  method like MoveTo(). MovedMessage should be sent immediately on any change.

* Geom must catch Moved and update accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Define Vector3.Up as a static settable property

* Be sure to call GC.SuppressFinalize() in all Dispose() methods

* Memory leaks, apparently from ODE. Route ODE memory allocations through the
  toolkit to get line numbers. Probably the static trimesh memory from last time.

* Add Dispatcher.Remove() ... compare to delegate.Target and remove if it
  matches the given instance. Also, can I use WeakDelegates? Should I?

* Refactor master list of platform windows to match master list of render targets

* Internationalize the editor

* Add AssemblyInfo.cs with CLSCompliant flag to all assemblies, except maybe
  the editor (also add tickler to packaging to update versions)
  
* The `start` parameter on utDraw() is unused.

* Change texture formats to match Toolkit symbols

* Can I remove utMatrix4 from Toolkit wrapper?

* Unit tests for SetMatrix() and SetTexture()

* What kind of buffer options are there (static, dynamic, what else)? Have
  a look at that too.

* Popup window when exceptions are caught (sample base class)

* Trace log should use \n\r on windows so it can be read in Notepad. Engine
  messages are okay, but messages from the Toolkit are \n only. Maybe do a
  Replace() on incoming text (how to detect platform EOL sequence?)

* Possible performance enhancement: Put a StepNumber in DynamicsSystem that 
  gets incremented in OnTick(). In RigidBody, keep a LastUpdatedStepNumber.
  When someone reads position or orientation, check to see if I am out of
  date (LastUpdatedStepNumber !== DS.StepNumber) and pull info.

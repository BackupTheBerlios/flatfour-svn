Should G2 source code be included in F4 distribution?

  The question is, I guess, whether the G2 code would need to be modified in
  order to support F4, or if changes only flow up from G2. There is always a
  possibility that a bug could be discovered, or that a new method would be
  needed, and it would be easiest to effect the change immediately without
  pulling down the new features in G2, which might break the F4 build. So
  it would be safest to work with a branch of G2, but always make sure that
  the changes have been pushed back and a G2 version released before releasing
  a new F4 version.
  
  So yes, keep a branch of the G2 code in the F4 distribution. Anyone working
  from Subversion will get the latest code.
